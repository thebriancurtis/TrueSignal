# Getting Started with TrueSignal

TrueSignal gives you fine-grained control over ChatGPT assistant behavior using a validated system of rules.

## What Can I Do With It?
- Add clarity, structure, and factuality to ChatGPT responses
- Configure tone, persona, domain specificity, and formatting
- Combine rule sets to adapt behavior in specific contexts

## What's a Rule?
A **rule** defines a constraint like:
- "The assistant must avoid speculation."
- "The assistant must use structured bullet points."

Rules are grouped into **rule sets**, which are validated, compiled, and published.

## How to Use It
1. Pick a rule set from `/rule_sets/`
2. Add it to your system or ChatGPT instructions
3. Apply it with the core rule set for reliability
