# Using Rule Sets

## What is a Rule Set?
A collection of behavior rules applied to ChatGPT. Each rule set has a purpose like "legal tone" or "persona: teacher".

## How to Apply
- Always include the `core` rule set
- Add any number of themed rule sets

## Where to Find Them
Compiled sets live in:
```
/rule_sets/{category}/{name}.json
```

Use with your assistant configuration or as part of your ChatGPT custom instructions.
