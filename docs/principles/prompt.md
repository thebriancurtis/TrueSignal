# Prompt Principles

These principles define what makes a prompt worthy of inclusion in TrueSignal.  
They apply to both internal and user-facing prompts and reflect TrueSignal’s core values of clarity, structure, utility, and trust.

> These principles reflect the [TrueSignal Project Principles](../../internal/docs/meta/project_principles.md) and help ensure prompts align with the goals of the system.

---

### 1. Support Responsible Use

A prompt must align with fair, safe, and respectful use of AI assistants.  
It must not embed harm, manipulation, or unfair advantage.

---

### 2. Solve a Meaningful Problem

Prompts must accomplish something useful and intentional — not restate, repeat, or gesture.

---

### 3. Produce Reliable Results

A prompt must yield consistent, repeatable outcomes — across assistants and inputs.  
No surprises. No regressions. No contradictions.

---

### 4. Do One Thing Well

Scope the prompt to a single task.  
It must be composable, independently useful, and free of side effects.

---

### 5. Break Down Logic into Assistant-Readable Steps

Structure your instructions clearly.  
Avoid tangled flows, hidden logic, or compressed multi-step reasoning.

---

### 6. Use Exact Language

Every instruction should be direct, specific, and unambiguous.  
Avoid vague goals or overloaded verbs.

---

### 7. Make Behavior Observable

A prompt must produce visible, reviewable output.  
If the result can’t be inspected, it can’t be trusted.
