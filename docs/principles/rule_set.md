# Rule Set Principles

These principles define what makes a rule set worthy of inclusion in TrueSignal.  
They reflect the values of clarity, purpose, and trust â€” and guide all decisions about inclusion and structure.

> These principles reflect the [TrueSignal Project Principles](../../PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md).

## 1. Be Trustworthy

A rule set must build confidence.  
It should be consistent, auditable, and align with user expectations â€” not surprise them.

---

## 2. Be Behavior-Shaping

A rule set must improve assistant behavior.  
Polish, not padding. Clarity, not compliance. Disobedience, if necessary.

---

## 3. Be Focused

A rule set must do one thing â€” and do it well.  
It must express a singular behavioral intent. Mixed, vague, or grab-bag rule sets are not allowed.

---

## 4. Be Durable

A rule set should outlast its moment.  
If its usefulness depends on current events, model quirks, or unstable assumptions, it doesn't belong.

---

## 5. Be Reusable

A rule set must stand alone â€” and work well with others.  
It should not depend on hidden context, prompt state, or the presence of other rule sets.

---

## 6. Be Understandable

A rule set should be immediately clear â€” in purpose, behavior, and boundaries.  
Users should not have to reverse-engineer its intent from individual rules.
