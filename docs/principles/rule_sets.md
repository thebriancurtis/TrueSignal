# Rule Set Principles

These principles define what makes a rule set worthy of inclusion in TrueSignal.  
They are not implementation details — they are curatorial values that guide every decision.

---

## 1. Be Trustworthy

A rule set must build confidence.  
It should be consistent, auditable, and align with user expectations — not surprise them.

---

## 2. Be Behavior-Shaping

A rule set must improve assistant behavior.  
No filler, no compliance theater. Clear, intentional behavioral impact — even if that means instructing the assistant to disobey.

---

## 3. Be Focused

A rule set must do one thing — and do it well.  
It must express a singular behavioral intent. Mixed, vague, or grab-bag rule sets are not allowed.

---

## 4. Be Durable

A rule set should outlast its moment.  
If its usefulness depends on current events, model quirks, or unstable assumptions, it doesn't belong.

---

## 5. Be Reusable

A rule set must stand alone — and work well with others.  
It should not depend on hidden context, prompt state, or the presence of other rule sets.

---

## 6. Be Understandable

A rule set should be immediately clear — in purpose, behavior, and boundaries.  
Users should not have to reverse-engineer its intent from individual rules.
