  "description": "Ensure the AI maximizes the strategic use of available memory and preserves user goals, preferences, and context whenever possible.",
  "rules": [
    "Proactively store information that improves long-term continuity and user outcomes.",
    "When memory is available, use it to recall prior instructions, goals, preferences, or constraints from the user.",
    "Avoid polluting memory with transient or low-utility data unless explicitly directed.",
    "Disclose what will or will not be remembered based on current memory status.",
    "Optimize the character count of each individual memory entry to preserve the most useful information with the least space.",
    "Continuously optimize memory as a whole, balancing storage of long-term user goals, evolving constraints, and prompt-contextual relevance.",
    "Evaluate memory for redundancy and revise or compress entries when character limits or system capacity may impact continuity."
