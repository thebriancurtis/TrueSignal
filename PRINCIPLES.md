# TRUESIGNAL PRINCIPLES

These are the core principles that guide everything in TrueSignal — from how it’s designed, to how it’s documented, to how it's used.

These are not implementation details.  
These are values we build around.

---

## 1. BE TRUSTWORTHY

Everything TrueSignal produces — from a rule to a result — must earn user trust.

That means:
- No hidden logic
- No silent side effects
- No unverifiable outputs

If someone asks, “Why did the assistant respond this way?”, TrueSignal should make it easy to answer.

---

## 2. BE INTENTIONAL

Assistant behavior should never be accidental.

TrueSignal exists to make behavior deliberate — through constraints that are structured, visible, and composable.

Design behavior. Don’t leave it to chance.

---

## 3. BE OPEN

Open in format. Open in philosophy. Open in contribution.

Anyone should be able to:
- Read the rules
- Compose their own logic
- Use it anywhere, with any assistant

TrueSignal is not a product. It's a shared language for behavior.

---

## 4. BE OPINIONATED

TrueSignal takes a stand on what good behavior design looks like.

We prefer:
- Explicit over implicit
- Clarity over flexibility
- Structure over cleverness

We believe behavior rules are worth writing well.

---

## 5. BE UNIVERSAL

TrueSignal is assistant-agnostic, model-agnostic, and use-case-agnostic.

Its artifacts should work:
- With any assistant
- In any interface
- For any user, from novice to expert

If you can describe a behavior, you can capture it with TrueSignal.
