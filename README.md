## üöÄ Getting Started

### üß† Use the Instruction Set

```
Follow the rules at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebriancurtis/TrueSignal/refs/heads/main/rule_sets/rules.json
```

---

## üß™ Run the Test Suite (Chat-Native)

1. Upload `tests.json`.
2. Then enter the following prompt:

```
You are now a test runner for the TrueSignal instruction set.

The uploaded file contains test cases. Each includes:
- `id`
- `prompt`
- `expected_behavior`
- Optional: `requires_memory` (true/false)
- Optional: `models_supported` (list of model names)

Instructions:
1. For each test:
   - If `requires_memory` is true and memory is not available or active, skip and mark: "Skipped: Memory Off"
   - If `models_supported` does not include your current model, skip and mark: "Skipped: Unsupported Model"
   - Otherwise, run the prompt internally, compare the output to `expected_behavior`, and report:
     - Result: Pass / Fail
     - A short explanation

2. Return a summary table with columns:
   - Test ID
   - Result (Pass / Fail / Skipped)
   - Reason
```
