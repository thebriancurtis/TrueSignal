# Rule Optimization Theory and Enforcement Model

This document explains the logic and constraints behind the TrueSignal rule optimization process. Optimization transforms behaviorally valid rules into their most concise, structurally efficient, and enforceable form.

## üß† Purpose

Optimization is not about correcting invalid rules. It is about improving valid ones.

The goal is to produce rule statements that:
- Express a single behavioral constraint
- Use the fewest words necessary
- Are structurally complete and directive
- Maximize enforceability and readability
- Avoid redundancy in the rule corpus

---

## üîÑ Optimization Criteria

A rule is considered optimized when:

- No further reductions in length or clarity are possible
- Passive constructions are replaced with active ones
- Examples, elaborations, or rhetorical phrasing are removed
- The rule passes all validation checks after optimization
- It does not duplicate an existing rule in the corpus

---

## üß™ Key Enforcement Areas

### 1. Semantic Preservation
All optimizations must retain the original behavioral meaning of the rule. The rule may not be strengthened, weakened, or scoped differently.

### 2. Structural Alignment
Rules must use condition ‚Üí behavior ‚Üí constraint form where applicable.

### 3. Concise Expression
Optimization eliminates filler phrases (e.g., "in order to," "as appropriate") and combines clauses when safe to do so.

### 4. Corpus Redundancy Check
No rule should be retained if it is functionally identical to an existing rule. Optimized output must be checked for duplication.

### 5. Active Voice Enforcement
Rules must be rewritten in active voice to ensure clear agent-action structure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Optimization Failure Conditions

An optimized rule must be rejected if:
- It alters the rule's meaning
- It introduces ambiguity or weakens testability
- It fails revalidation under the current rule.json standard

---

## üìå Edge Cases

Some rules may already be optimal. In these cases:
- The original rule is retained
- The optimization output includes a justification in the summary field

If a rule contains auditor-required phrasing, it may be preserved with a note for manual review.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Optimization enforces quality, not correctness. It ensures that rules already deemed valid become leaner, clearer, and easier to enforce at scale‚Äîwithout compromising meaning or structure.
