# Lessons Learned: TrueSignal Core Design

This document synthesizes the full range of lessons gathered throughout the design, critique, and refinement of the TrueSignal `core` rule eligibility principles. These insights have emerged from a series of structured investigations and documents across law, history, science, philosophy, system failure, and best practices.

## üìö Source Documents and Investigations

The following documents were synthesized into this analysis:

- `core_design_failures_and_lessons.md`
- `core_law_lessons.md`
- `core_lessons_from_history.md`
- `core_lessons_from_everything.md`
- All versions of `core_rule_eligibility.md` (v0‚Äìv7)

## üß† Key Lessons and Their Implications

### 1. Clarity Prevents Catastrophe
- Lessons from aviation, law, and language ambiguity
- Every rule must have one interpretation
- Implicit behavior is a bug

---

### 2. Enumerated Behavior Only
- Inspired by the U.S. Constitution and code security
- If it isn‚Äôt explicitly allowed in `core`, it‚Äôs disallowed
- Prevents unauthorized behavioral creep

---

### 3. No Precedent or Pattern Drift
- Informed by failures in legal precedent and LLM modeling
- `core` cannot inherit behavior from corpus or frequency
- Prevents learned tone, style, or hedging

---

### 4. Explicit Trigger Conditions
- From GDPR and aerospace auditing
- Every rule must declare its activation logic
- Disallows ‚Äújust-in-case‚Äù behavioral policies

---

### 5. Observability and Testability
- Every rule must include at least one example/test case
- Test cases show necessity and outcome
- Enables enforcement and future regression checks

---

### 6. Ethical and Intent Modeling Prohibited
- Inspired by AI ethics and postcolonial critique
- No assumption of user intent, belief, or morality
- `core` must only act on validated input

---

### 7. Feedback Discipline
- Inspired by social media amplification, AI overgeneration
- Rules cannot cause behavioral recursion or stacking
- Memory and continuity rules must define decay or limit logic

---

### 8. Reviewer Accountability
- Prevent rules based on convenience, corpus, or cultural assumption
- Require justification using explicit criteria
- Schema + tools + human review

---

### 9. Blank Space Is Not Permission
- From legal loopholes and code ambiguity
- Absence of rule ‚â† allowance of behavior
- Composability must be deliberate

---

### 10. No Corpus-Derived Behavior
- Inspired by AI safety failures
- Prevents passive inclusion of bad behavior patterns
- All behavior must be defined and enforced directly

---

## üîç Cross-Cutting Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Precision | Only explicitly defined behavior may exist in core |
| Testability | Rules must have observable activation and failure |
| Boundedness | Behavior must have limits to prevent recursion |
| Universality | Rules must apply across all domains, users, and sessions |
| Responsibility | Reviewers must justify, not infer or replicate |

---

## ‚úÖ Results of Integration

These lessons are fully embedded in:
- `core_rule_eligibility_7.md` (version-controlled)
- `rule_schema_6.json` (enforcing test cases)
- Internal analysis docs for context and rationale

The result is a constitutional-grade, semantically stable foundation for all system behavior, with mechanisms to prevent drift, ideological creep, or unexamined assumptions.
