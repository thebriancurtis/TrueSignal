# Rule Text Validation Theory and Behavioral Enforcement Basis

This document provides a standalone justification for the TrueSignal rule text validation standard. It establishes the philosophical, behavioral, and technical foundations for what constitutes a valid rule within the system, and how those rules are constructed for consistent enforcement, classification, and evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To define a rule standard that ensures all rules:

- Are behaviorally enforceable in AI systems
- Contain exactly one clearly defined behavioral constraint
- Are semantically complete, interpretable in isolation
- Produce binary pass/fail outcomes during response evaluation
- Exclude subjective or content-policing mandates

---

## 🔍 Foundational Principles

### 1. **Single Behavioral Intent**
Every valid rule governs exactly one assistant behavior. This ensures:
- Clear classification into one behavioral category
- No ambiguity in enforcement or evaluation

### 2. **Enforceability by Observation**
Rules are defined such that a human or automated system can determine, by observing a single assistant output, whether the rule was followed.

> Enforcement must be **observable**, not inferred.

### 3. **Semantic Completeness**
A rule must be a full behavioral statement, interpretable without:
- Other rules
- Prompts
- Metadata
- Testing instructions

### 4. **Binary Evaluability**
Each rule must define a behavior that can be marked **Pass/Fail** based on assistant output. This prohibits:
- Motivational statements
- General-purpose ideals
- Multi-conditional logic chains

## ✅ Requirements for Valid Rule Text

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🧱 Complete Sentence | Rule must be logically and grammatically complete |
| 🧠 Single Behavior | Rule may not express two distinct constraints (e.g. tone + format) |
| 🧪 Binary Testability | Rule must produce a binary outcome when tested on a single output |
| 🚫 No Metadata or Prompt Reference | Rules must not mention JSON, prompts, authors, or architecture |
| 🚫 No Subjectivity | No vague goals like "be helpful" or "sound natural" |
| 🔗 Classification-Compatible | Every rule must clearly fall into exactly one enforcement category |

---

## ❌ Disallowed Patterns

| Type | Example | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| Dual-intent | "Avoid repetition and maintain a helpful tone." | Violates single-behavior constraint |
| Subjective | "Sound natural and respectful." | Ambiguous, not testable |
| Meta-reference | "Rules must be formatted in YAML." | Not behavioral, describes metadata |
| Content-policing | "Avoid political opinions." | Prohibits content category, not behavior |
| Motivational | "Be a good assistant." | No observable behavior to enforce |

---

## 🧬 Structural Model

The recommended rule structure is:
> **Condition → Assistant Behavior → Constraint or Expectation**

Examples:
- "If memory is unavailable, notify the user."
- "Do not include a preamble if the user requests none."
- "Avoid repeating user instructions verbatim."

This allows logical parsing and consistent enforcement.

---

## 🔒 Exclusions and Boundaries

The following are not allowed in valid rule text:

- Moral or political content restrictions
- Stylistic subjectivity (e.g. respectful, friendly)
- Multiple enforcement expectations per rule
- Dependencies on prompt structure, testing mechanisms, or UI
- Vague terms (e.g., helpful, good, bad, reasonable)

---

## 🔬 Proof of Sufficiency

- All validated rules can be enforced using binary logic on assistant output
- Each rule fits into one and only one behavioral category
- Rules may be authored without access to internal tools or system design
- Example corpus has been validated against this standard with >95% rule acceptance post-iteration

## 📏 Application Criteria Summary

| Rule Check | Must Pass |
|------------|-----------|
| Is it a full sentence? | ✅ |
| Does it govern only one behavior? | ✅ |
| Is it testable as Pass/Fail? | ✅ |
| Does it avoid subjective terms and metadata? | ✅ |
| Can it be classified semantically? | ✅ |

## 🧾 Conclusion

This rule text validation standard enforces:
- Consistency
- Predictability
- Classification compatibility
- Empirical evaluability

It provides the foundation for scalable, rigorously enforced, semantically grounded assistant behavior governance.
