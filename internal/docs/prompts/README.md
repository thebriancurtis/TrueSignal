## ðŸ§­ Prompt Types

### ðŸ”§ Internal Prompts (`/internal/prompts/`)
Used for validation, transformation, and compilation. Manually run in an AI assistant or composed into higher-level flows.

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `validate_rule.json` | Checks atomicity, teachability, testability |
| `optimize_rule.json` | Shortens rule language without losing intent |
| `rule_deduplication.json` | Flags potential overlap with existing rules |
| `rule_consolidation.json` | Merges redundant rules |
| `is_core_rule.json` | Determines whether a rule belongs in `core` |
| `validate_rule_set.json` | Checks rule set structure and references |
| `compile_rule_set.json` | Merges and validates rule set + core |
| `suggest_rule_set_category.json` | Classifies rule set by theme |

### ðŸ’¬ User-Facing Prompts (`/prompts/`)
Prompts designed to be used directly by an AI assistant users (currently none published).

User-facing prompts:
- Must conform to `prompt.json`
- Should reference compiled rule sets by link
- Should expose helpful assistant functionality (e.g. enforcement, optimization)
