# Documentation Principles

These principles reflect TrueSignal’s [Project Principles](../../../PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md).  
They guide how documentation is written, reviewed, and maintained across the project.

---

## 1. Be Accurate  
Every claim must be true and verifiable.

## 2. Be Purposeful  
Don’t write what doesn’t need to exist.

## 3. Be Clear  
Prefer precision over cleverness.

## 4. Be Accessible  
Assume no background knowledge.

## 5. Be Universal  
Avoid model-specific assumptions.

## 6. Be Honest  
Say exactly what something does — and doesn’t — do.

## 7. Be Organized  
Every document must be discoverable and connected.
